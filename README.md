# AutomationOfAmazonEC2AMIBackup
# Project Title

The main objective of this project is to manage the EC2 AMI backup for EC2 Instances using AWS lambda functions in Python. Creating a backup for each EC2 Instance and deleting the EC2 AMIs that are older than 30 days or more. Using Python and AWS Lambda Functions, the whole process is going to be self-triggered. When deletion is happened, using AWS SNS, a notification will be sent to the registered email address. This project uses technologies like AWS EC2, AWS SNS, AWS CloudWatch, and the programming language that will be used in this project is Python.

## Getting Started
*1* Create an AWS account and set up an admin role.
