Project Idea and Rules:
Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS: A VPC allows you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. You can create subnets, assign security groups, and configure network access control lists to provide a high level of network security.

Use Security Groups: AWS security groups act as a firewall for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. You can create security groups and specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that are allowed to reach your instances.

Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs): NACLs are an additional layer of security that act as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of your subnets. You can create rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers.

Automate Security Tasks with Python: You can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate security tasks like creating and managing VPCs, security groups, and NACLs. You can write scripts to automate the creation of secure VPCs and to manage security group rules and NACL rules.

Here are some general steps to get started:

Set up an AWS account if you don't already have one.
Familiarize yourself with the AWS services you plan to use (VPC, Security Groups, NACLs) and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
Decide on the network security setup you want to implement (e.g., subnets, security groups, NACLs).
Write Python scripts using Boto3 to automate the creation and management of your network security resources.
Test your scripts to ensure that they are working as expected.
Deploy your scripts in your production environment to secure your network infrastructure.

AWS Security Group monitoring: Use Amazon EC2 Security Groups to control inbound and outbound network traffic and use Python to monitor the security groups for changes and alert you when an unexpected change is detected.
